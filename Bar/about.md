Hi! My name is Kasper. 

I currently work as a quant researcher and a developer in a hedge fund, trying to build models to estimate the market and part of the world by observing it. 

I love Bach music & calligraphy, break dancing & hip-hop, tech & cars, industrial design & liberal arts, writing & coding, walking & thinking ... and yes, I love observing this lovely world.

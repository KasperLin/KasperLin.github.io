Hi! My name is Kasper (Inspired by [Casper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost) , named by my mom). 

I currently work as a quant researcher and developer in a hedge fund, trying to build models to estimate the market and the world by observing it. 

I love Bach music & calligraphy, break dancing & hip-hop, tech & cars, industrial design & liberal arts, definitions & analogies, writing & coding, walking & thinking ... and yes, I love observing this lovely world.

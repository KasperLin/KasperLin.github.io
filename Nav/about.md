title: About Me
---

Hi, my name is Kasper (inspired by [Casper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost) 👻, named by my mom). 

I currently work as a quant researcher and developer in a hedge fund,  building models of the market base on my observations 👀. 

I **love** ❤ Bach music & dancing, tech & cars, design & liberal arts, definitions & analogies, writing & coding, walking & thinking ... and yes, I love observing this lovely world.
